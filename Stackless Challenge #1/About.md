# ðŸ“Š Stackless Challenge #1: **Implementing SCD Type 2 in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse with PySpark**

Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 is a technique used in data warehousing to **track historical changes** in dimension data without losing the past. Instead of overwriting records, it inserts new versions and marks old ones as inactive.

### ðŸ§ª The Challenge

Implement SCD Type 2 in a Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse using PySpark, tracking changes in employee data over time while preserving a complete history.

We use a sample dataset [scd_data.csv](https://github.com/DonFrancis1/FabricSaturdayChallenges/blob/main/Challenge%201%20-%20Implementing%20Type%202%20SCD%20in%20a%20lakehouse/PROJECT_DETAILS.md) from the Fabric User Group Nigeria challenge.
